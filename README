Authenticated-bcrypt

This plugin is a quick tweak to acts_as_authenticated which uses Coda Hale's BCrypt library instead of the weaker SHA1.

=============================
TO USE:
=============================

You need to install bcrypt-ruby before you get started:

sudo gem install bcrypt-ruby

normally does the trick. Consult http://bcrypt-ruby.rubyforge.org/ for a more concise explanation of why this is a good thing.


Once you've installed the plugin, all the generators are the same as the original techno-weenie plugin, there's just one less column in the user table as the salted password + hash are concatenated into a single field called 'password'.
